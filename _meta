  <description>This package provides some directories which are required by other
packages which comprise the modularized X.Org X11R7 X Window System
release.  This package must be installed during OS installation
or upgrade, in order to force the creation of these directories,
and replace any legacy symbolic links that might be present in old
locations, which could result in upgrade failures.
